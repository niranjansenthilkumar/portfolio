# Niranjan (NJ) Senthilkumar

I am a Machine Learning Engineer based in San Francisco.

I currently work at Apple, and my work has ranged from building infrastructure tools to serve machine learning teams, to now collaborating on innovative machine learning initiatives.

Prior to Apple, I created iOS apps with over 100,000 downloads, and studied Computer Science at Cornell. I am passionate about software and its role in disrupting large facets across industries.
